### Hey There Fellow Devs 👋🛹

Hi, I'm Amir! I'm a full stack software engineer and *LOOVVE* unpaid open-source.
I have had the experience of working with a number of different web technologies I won't bore you with.

During my years, I have been mainly dealing with:

- TypeScript & JavaScript (and their runtimes, frameworks, etc.)
- React & Next.js
- PostgreSQL & Redis
- Microservices
- Algorithms and Data Structures

🔭 but recently I have been trying to learn Go and it's been hella fun. It's my love for performance, I think.

I'm planning to share my notes on my blog ([zouerami.dev](https://zouerami.dev)).

Wish me luck!
